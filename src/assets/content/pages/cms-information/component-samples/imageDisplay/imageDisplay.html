<p>
    The <strong>Image Display Component</strong> is an Angular component designed to showcase images dynamically. It reads image data, including file paths, titles, and descriptions, from a JSON file and displays them in a responsive gallery. Each image opens in a modal window when clicked, providing a larger view along with additional details. This component leverages Bootstrap for styling, ensuring a clean and user-friendly interface while promoting scalability and easy content updates.
