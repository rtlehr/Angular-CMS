  The <strong>Info-Highlite</strong> Component is an Angular standalone component designed to display an image slider with accompanying text boxes that allow users to navigate through different images and highlights. The component automatically cycles through images at a set interval but also allows manual selection, resetting the auto-scroll on interaction. It dynamically loads image data from a JSON file, ensuring flexibility in content updates without modifying the code. This component is particularly useful for showcasing key highlights, promotional banners, or featured content in a visually engaging way while maintaining responsiveness across different screen sizes.
