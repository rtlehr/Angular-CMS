    The <strong>Content Component</strong> is a dynamic Angular component that reads information from external HTML files and displays it seamlessly on the screen. By fetching and rendering content at runtime, this component allows for modular, maintainable, and easily updatable pages without modifying the main application code. This approach is ideal for building scalable applications where content can be managed separately, enabling flexibility and improving overall development efficiency.
