    The <strong>News Component</strong> is designed to display news articles dynamically by loading content from a JSON file. Each news item includes a title, summary, and publication date, which are neatly rendered in a structured layout for easy readability. The component leverages Bootstrap for styling and responsiveness, ensuring the content adapts seamlessly across different screen sizes. This flexible approach allows for quick updates to the news feed without altering the core code, making it ideal for content-rich applications.
