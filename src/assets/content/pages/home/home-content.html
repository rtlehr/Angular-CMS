    <h2>About Our Simple Content Management System (CMS)</h2>
    <p>
      We have built a <strong>simple Content Management System (CMS)</strong> using <strong>Angular</strong>, a modern front-end framework. The CMS includes dynamic components such as menus, sidebars, modals, and customizable page content, all seamlessly managed and controlled. Key technologies used in this system include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Angular:</strong> A component-based framework to build scalable, dynamic user interfaces.</li>
      <li><strong>TypeScript:</strong> For structured and strongly typed JavaScript code.</li>
      <li><strong>Bootstrap:</strong> For responsive and visually appealing UI design.</li>
      <li><strong>RxJS (Reactive Extensions for JavaScript):</strong> To handle reactive state management and observables.</li>
      <li><strong>Custom Modal Components and Services:</strong> To enable global control of modals across the application.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This architecture allows components like <code>&lt;app-header-menu&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;app-side-menu&gt;</code>, and modals to be reused and dynamically updated, making the application flexible and maintainable.
    </p>
  
    <h3>Advantages of Building This Way</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Reusability:</strong> Components such as menus, sidebars, and modals can be reused across different parts of the application.</li>
      <li><strong>Modularity:</strong> Code is organized into independent components and services, improving maintainability.</li>
      <li><strong>Dynamic Content:</strong> JSON data can be loaded and updated dynamically without reloading the page.</li>
      <li><strong>Responsive UI:</strong> Integration with Bootstrap ensures the interface is mobile-friendly and visually appealing.</li>
      <li><strong>Global State Control:</strong> Services like the <code>ModalService</code> enable centralized control of components, such as opening modals globally.</li>
      <li><strong>Scalability:</strong> The component-based architecture makes it easy to scale the CMS as new features are added.</li>
    </ul>
  
    <p>
      Overall, this simple CMS demonstrates how Angular can be leveraged to create highly responsive, modular, and reusable applications, while maintaining a clean and structured codebase.
