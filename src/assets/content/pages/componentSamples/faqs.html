    The <strong>FAQ Component</strong> is designed to display frequently asked questions dynamically by loading data from a JSON file. It lists all questions at the top of the page, allowing users to click and auto-scroll to the corresponding answers below. Each answer includes the question and its detailed response, with a "Back to Top" link for seamless navigation. Leveraging Bootstrap for styling ensures the layout is clean, responsive, and user-friendly, providing an efficient way to organize and access FAQ content.
