<p>
    The <strong>Image Gallery Component</strong> is a dynamic and responsive Angular component that displays a collection of images in a grid format. It reads image data, such as file paths, titles, and descriptions, from a JSON file and showcases smaller thumbnail images. When a thumbnail is clicked, a larger version of the image, along with its title and description, appears in a modal window. This component utilizes Bootstrap for layout and styling, ensuring a clean, organized, and user-friendly image browsing experience.
